***********
The concept
***********

Aldryn Boilerplates aims to solve a familiar Django problem. Sometimes re-usable applications need
to provide their own templates and staticfiles, but in order to be useful, these need to commit
themselves to particular frontend expectations - thereby obliging the adopter to override these
files in order to adapt the application to other frontends, or create a new fork of the project
aimed at a different frontend setup.

It's especially difficult to provide a rich and complete frontend for a re-usable application,
because there's a conflict between creating a *useful* frontend and creating an *agnostic* one.

The solution is to build in provision for different, switchable, frontend expectations into the
re-usable application, and this is what Aldryn Boilerplates does.

On the `Aldryn <http://aldryn.com>`_ platform, a *Boilerplate* is a complete set of frontend
expectations, assumptions, opinions, conventions, frameworks, templates, static files and more - a
standard way of working for frontend development.

Many developers do in fact work with their own preferred standard sets of frontend tools and code
for all their projects; in effect, with their own Boilerplates, even if they don't use that name.
Aldryn Boilerplates is intended to make it easier to provide support for multiple Boilerplates in
res-usable applications, and to switch between them.

If users of a particular frontend framework or system would like to use it with a certain re-usable
application, they now no longer need to rip out and replace the existing one, or override it at the
project level every single time. Instead with Aldryn Boilerplates they can simply *add* the
frontend files to the application, alongside the ones for existing supported Boilerplates.

A simple setting in the project tells applications that support Aldryn Boilerplates which one to
use.


*************************
Using Aldryn Boilerplates
*************************

Aldryn Boilerplates doesn't change the way regular files in ``templates`` and ``static`` are
discovered - a re-usable application that supports Aldryn Boilerplates can also work perfectly well
in a project that doesn't have it installed.

However, to support Aldryn Boilerplates, your application should place Boilerplate-specific
frontend files in ``boilerplates/my-boilerplate-name/templates/`` and
``boilerplates/my-boilerplate-name/static/``.

For example, to add support for the Standard Aldryn Boilerplate (`aldryn-boilerplate-bootstrap3`_)
to your application, place the files in ``boilerplates/bootstrap3/templates/`` and
``boilerplates/bootstrap3/static/``.

.. hint::
    don't forget to add ``boilerplates`` to ``Manifest.in``, alongside ``static`` and ``templates``
    when creating Python packages.

.. note::
    The convention is to prefix the github repository name with ``aldryn-boilerplate-``. Your
    Boilerplate could be called something like ``aldryn-boilerplate-mycompany-awesome``. To use it
    in a project, you'd set ``ALDRYN_BOILERPLATE_NAME = 'mycompany-awesome'`` and put templates
    and static files into ``boilerplates/mycompany-awesome/`` in Addons.
    ``ALDRYN_BOILERPLATE_NAME`` is set automatically on Aldryn based on
    ``"identifier": "mycompany-awesome"`` in ``boilerplate.json`` when submitting a boilerplate to
    Aldryn.


************
Installation
************

.. note::
    aldryn-boilerplates comes pre-installed on the Aldryn Platform and
    ``ALDRYN_BOILERPLATE_NAME`` is set automatically.

::

    pip install aldryn-boilerplates


*************
Configuration
*************

Django 1.8+
-----------

In general configuration stays the same but you should respect changes that
were introduced by django 1.8.
In particular in Django 1.8 context processors were moved from ``django.core``
to ``django.template``.

Be sure to include ``aldryn_boilerplates`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``, adjust
``STATICFILES_FINDERS`` and finally configure ``TEMPLATES``.

For ``TEMPLATES`` you need to add
``aldryn_boilerplates.context_processors.boilerplate`` to ``context_processors``
and alter ``loaders`` in the same way as we do it for Django versions prior
to 1.8.

**Note** that in the example below we are altering the default values,
so if you are using something that is custom - don't forget to add that too.

Here is an example of a simple configuration:

::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'aldryn_boilerplates',
        ...
    ]

    STATICFILES_FINDERS = (
        'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder',
        'aldryn_boilerplates.staticfile_finders.AppDirectoriesFinder',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder',
    )

    TEMPLATES = [
        {
            'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
            'OPTIONS': {
                'context_processors': [
                    'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                    'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
                    'django.template.context_processors.i18n',
                    'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                    'django.template.context_processors.request',
                    'django.template.context_processors.media',
                    'django.template.context_processors.csrf',
                    'django.template.context_processors.tz',
                    'sekizai.context_processors.sekizai',
                    'django.template.context_processors.static',
                    'cms.context_processors.cms_settings',
                    'aldryn_boilerplates.context_processors.boilerplate',
                ],
                'loaders': [
                    'django.template.loaders.filesystem.Loader',
                    'aldryn_boilerplates.template_loaders.AppDirectoriesLoader',
                    'django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader',
                ],
            },
        },
    ]


******************************************************
Adding aldryn-boilerplate support to existing packages
******************************************************

The recommended approach is to add a dependency to aldryn-boilerplates and to move existing
``static`` and ``template`` files to a boilerplate folder (completely remove ``static`` and
``templates``). If you're in the process of re-factoring your existing templates with something
new, put them into the ``legacy`` boilerplate folder and set ``ALDRYN_BOILERPLATE_NAME='legacy'``
on projects that are still using the old templates.
The new and shiny project can then use ``ALDRYN_BOILERPLATE_NAME='bootstrap3'`` to use the new
Aldryn Bootstrap Boilerplate (`aldryn-boilerplate-bootstrap3`_). Or any other
boilerplate for that matter.

Removing ``static`` and ``templates`` has the benefit of removing likely deprecated templates
from the very prominent location, that will confuse newcomers. It also prevents having not-relevant
templates and static files messing up your setup.
